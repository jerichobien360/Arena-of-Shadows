## Overview
A 2D pixel RPG fighting game where you battle waves of shadowy enemies in an ancient arena. Choose your class, upgrade your stats, and master light, heavy, block, and dodge mechanics to survive. Fight, level up, and conquer this arena.

<h3>üéØProject Vision</h3>
<p>The game is built to be more than entertainment, as it is primarily focused on the <b>open-source game project</b>, particularly Python developers who want to get started into game development, like me.

With a feature tool of:
- Modular level system
- Adaptive AI
- And a Custom Level Editor

It can transform into a tool that expands scalability from small to medium projects, as you may allow to use this project's tool for your reference towards the development with Pygame.</p>
