Bug to Fix:
1. Combat System: The enemy were glitching when they make a formation, other code classes were possibly not used there correctly.
2. Canera System: When perfirming to zoom in/out, the other objects were not affected (attack range of player), and when it reverts back, they are not the same as the original one.


For Improvement:
1. Background System: The background itself were not great, so it should refine it and make it more lively atmosphere.
2. Collision System: Since it is for prototyping, it shall be used a masking collision to get accurately when the objects collide.
3. Game Difficulty: Since the enemies were too OP (especially to the sniper and fireshooter), implementing of dash skills and inventory system


Additional Features to be Added:
1. Looting System
2. Inventory System
3. Map Editor (Including on the Mobs, Obstacles, Loots, Events, Sounds, Text Scripts)
4. Animation System (since it is getting hassles to work with a large code)
5. Minimap
6. Save/Load System
7. Stats (as for the result of the game and achievements in general)
8. Game Settings (Configuration on the screen size, audio, etc.)


Possible to Add in the Future:
1. Loading Screen (Since Pygame is slow and thus this will be used for multi-purposes)1



Final Thought:
Since this game meant to have fun, and this is on what game created for.
