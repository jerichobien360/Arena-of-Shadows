Bug to Fix:
1. Combat System: The enemy were glitching when they make a formation, other code classes were possibly not used there correctly.
2. Canera System: When perfirming to zoom in/out, the other objects were not affected (attack range of player), and when it reverts back, they are not the same as the original one.
3. Clean code: Through rearranging and refactoring the large code into a simple one


For Improvement:
1. Background System: The background itself were not great, so it should refine it and make it more lively atmosphere.
2. Collision System: Since it is for prototyping, it shall be used a masking collision to get accurately when the objects collide.
3. Game Difficulty: Since the enemies were too OP (especially to the sniper and fireshooter), implementing of dash skills and inventory system
4. Music: Adding the fade in/out effect to avoid a stuttering effect.


Additional Features to be Added:
1. Looting System
2. Inventory System
3. Map Editor (Including on the Mobs, Obstacles, Loots, Events, Sounds, Text Scripts)
4. Animation System (since it is getting hassles to work with a large code)
5. Minimap
6. Save/Load System
7. Stats (as for the result of the game and achievements in general)
8. Game Settings (Configuration on the screen size, audio, etc.)
9. Changelogs


Possible to Add in the Future:
1. Loading Screen (Since Pygame is slow and thus this will be used for multi-purposes)
2. Potions for HP and Mana (to make the game more balanced)
3. Mana, since the game is for prototyping ideas, implementing that to make a restriction for the dash effect (maybe for the other classes as well)


Final Thought:
Since this game meant to have fun, and this is on what game created for.


# NOTES:
## BUG FIXED (v1.1.4)
1. UI Manager: In the pause menu, when clicking to the menu button, it should directly go back to the main menu instead of when it performing the continue button to take an effect.
2. Mouse Cursor: When it performs on the pause and continue the game, the hand should transform back to the mouse pointer.
